## Scope <a name="scope"></a>

This library is designed to be cross-platform, supporting Linux, iOS, macOS and Windows (including C++/CLR contexts). The base standard is currenty C++20 to allow broad compiler support.

## Installation <a name="install"></a>

### Requirements <a name="require"></a>

Compiler must support C++20

### Dependencies <a name="depend"></a>

None

### Building <a name="build"></a>

The library can be built using a variety of tools. Unit tests build and run in each context:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| *Cmake* | Built against [DocTest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) |
| *Visual Studio* | Run in [Test Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer?view=vs-2022) |
| *Xcode* | Run with [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest) |


#### Cmake <a name="cmake"></a>

The following command-line instructions will build the library and tests:

	cmake -B ./build
	cmake --build ./build --config Release

> Note: Directing the output to a *build* directory is simply a practical suggestion, not a requirement. The build output can be directed anywhere.

For Visual Studio builds, it's prudent to specify a compiler and toolset, e.g.:

	cmake -B ./build/v143 -G "Visual Studio 17" -A x64 -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET=v143
	cmake --build ./build/v143 --config Release

Unit tests are built into a single executable called *activelibtests* and can be executed from the command-line, e.g.:

	./activelibtests

#### Visual Studio <a name="vs"></a>

- Open ActiveLib.sln in Visual Studio 2022
- Pick the target Release17
- Click the menu Build > Build Solution
- Run unit tests by clicking Test > Run All Tests

#### Xcode <a name="xcode"></a>

- Open ActiveLib.xcworkspace in Xcode
- Pick the scheme ActiveLib-Release
- Click the menu Product > Build
- Run unit tests by clicking Product > Test

### Documentation <a name="docs"></a>

The source contains Doxygen-style quotes for building a documentation set, which can be viewed [here](https://www.activethread.net/ActiveLib/Documentation/index.html).

Alternatively, the documentation can be built using the configuration file `./Documentation/Doxyfile`, either through the GUI application or from the command line: `doxygen ./Documentation/Doxyfile`

The latter will build the documentation into `./Documentation/html/`

### Using as IDE Project Dependency <a name="projdep"></a>

If ActiveLib is used as a dependency for an application within an IDE (VS or Xcode), the most convenient method is to embed the dependency directly into the parent solution/workspace so the library is automatically built and linked into the parent.


#### As a Visual Studio Dependency <a name="vsdepend"></a>

First add the ActiveLib project to your VS solution by right-clicking on the solution, picking *Add > Existing Project*, navigating to the ActiveLib project file and clicking *Open*.

![Add ActiveLib to a VS project](./Assets/Images/AddProjectVS.jpg){width=637}

The ActiveLib project should now appear in the solution explorer.

Next right-click on the *References* of the project to depend on ActiveLib and pick *Add Reference*. A dialog should appear with ActiveLib in a list - tick the adjacent check-box to add it as a reference.

![Reference ActiveLib in a VS project](./Assets/Images/RefProjectVS.jpg){width=342}

The solution explorer should now include:
1. The ActiveLib project
2. ActiveLib17 (or 16) as a referenced library.

![ActiveLib embedded in a VS project](./Assets/Images/EmbeddedProjectVS.jpg){width=342}

Any changes to ActiveLib should automatically build and link into your solution.

#### As an Xcode Dependency <a name="xcodedepend"></a>

First add the ActiveLib project to your Xcode workspace by right-clicking on the workspace, picking *Add Files to "Workspace"â€¦*, navigating to the ActiveLib project file and clicking Open.

![Add ActiveLib to an Xcode workspace](./Assets/Images/AddProjectXcode.jpg){width= 342}

Then add ActiveLib to the target as a dependency:
1. Click on the workspace;
2. Select the relevant target;
3. Click *Build Settings*;
4. Expand *Target Dependencies*;
5. Click the + button;
6. Select ActiveLib.

![Add ActiveLib to an Xcode workspace target](./Assets/Images/RefProjectXcode.jpg){width=1069}

The ActiveLib project should now appear in the workspace hierarchy.

Then add the ActiveLib product library to be linked against the build. The first 3 steps are as above - then:
1. Expand *Link Binary With Libraries*;
2. Click the + button;
3. Select *libActiveLib.a*

![Link ActiveLib into an Xcode target](./Assets/Images/LinkProjectXcode.jpg){width=1069}

Any changes to ActiveLib should automatically build and link into your project.
